- Horizontal and vertical alignment design: You can design the horizontal alignment of roads using transition curves (clothoids or cubic-parabola) and edit them graphically or numerically. You can also design the vertical alignment of roads using parabolic curves and view the profile and cross sections simultaneously.
- Cross section design: You can design the cross sections of roads using templates or manual editing. You can also define side slopes, ditches, berms, retaining walls, sidewalks, curbs, and other elements. You can calculate the cut and fill volumes and generate reports and tables.
- Pipes design: You can design water, sewage, drainage, and cable networks using Civilcad 2008. You can define pipes diameters, materials, slopes, manholes, valves, hydrants, and other accessories. You can also perform hydraulic calculations and generate longitudinal profiles and plan views.
- Earthworks design: You can design earthworks projects such as land leveling, excavation, filling, grading, and compaction using Civilcad 2008. You can create surfaces from points, contours, breaklines, or TIN models. You can also perform volume calculations and generate contour maps and cross sections.
- 3D simulation: You can create a realistic 3D simulation of your project using Civilcad Simulate module. You can visualize the side slopes, landscape effects, line of sight, etc. You can also simulate driving on the designed road and check the visibility and safety aspects. You can also place 3D objects such as houses, trees, traffic signals, light poles, etc.

## Conclusion
 
Civilcad 2008 is a powerful software that allows you to plan and design civil engineering projects in an efficient and accurate way. It integrates with Autocad and Bricscad environments and provides unique and professional tools for surveying, mapping, roads design, pipes design, earthworks design, and 3D simulation.
